# shopify-tab-delimited-product-feed
Use this repository to help create a basic text product feed that can be used with affiliate marketers. 

Be sure to make a collection template using the code and add all your products to the collection that you want in the feed.

To render the tab spaces, I use the <pre> tag and use CSS to display them inline as opposed to block and creating a new line.
